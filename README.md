## Hi there 👋
###**My name is Taskeen Ahmed**
-I am a Bachelors of science student majoring in neuroscience and I am in my fourth year📖👩‍🔬.
-==I enrolled in this NESC 3505 because I am interested in learning how to code and I wanted to know more about scientifc programing so that I can persue a careers in areas that include neuroimaging and neurotechnology. In addition, a few of my friends had recommended me to take this course as they enjoyed taking it in their previous years.== 🥼 💻🖱️
-==I took neuroscience because I wanted to study a discipline in university that includes the combination of both psychology and biology. I was intrigued to know more neurological and psychatrical conditions that indivisuals suffer from and I was facinated in learning more about the brains complexites and function.== 💊🔍🧠
*I have not figured out my careers plans yet however I want to be able to help others in the field of healthcare by making a difference in peoples lives and improve the well being of others.😄*
